5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
Once in the the greends-fads-first-project main directory we want to copy the temp files from the local directory of my-first-project. 
So the translation of this copy command is from the branch under copy all files stating temp- to the directory above.

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
Git init is a way to tell that this folder is a hidden repo. of git language. 
which theres is the metadata and folder that git uses to make changes to the version, make new documents etc. 
. So since in the beginning we created the hidden repo. to create the temp files and then we copied them to a online git repo. there was no change to the "language spoken".

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
Yes you must so that the temp files become avaliable in the git hub repo..
 So we begin by checking the status of the repo. which it will say that the files need to be commited, so we commit them with $ git commit * -m "initial commit". 
 Then we push your local repository to the remote GitHub repository.
